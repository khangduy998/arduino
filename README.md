# arduino parking timer
An idea for parking lots to automate parking timer
Using small, portable arduino, or raspberry with any distance sensor(here we used ultrasonic sensor) to capture car parking time
Timer starts when distance between sensor and car stabilizes. Timer can then be recorded to arduino and send to backend through REST API
